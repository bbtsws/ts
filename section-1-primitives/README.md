# Primitives

## Introduction

In this part of the workshop, we'll start with some basic exercises to introduce how we'll run this workshop
and the types of exercises we'll be working on.

We'll walk through this one with you all, but later on we'll be available as you walk through the steps in a self-guided manner.
