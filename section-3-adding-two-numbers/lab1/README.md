# Let's add!

In this lab we will add two numbers with the "value" system in TypeScript.

# Basic concepts:

```ts
type T = {something: number};
```
This defines a type T, which is an object that has a property called `something`, which is of type `number`.

```ts
type AB = A | B;
```
This defines a type `AB` that can be either an `A` or a `B`.

## Instructions

1. Copy in Playground the contents of [`add.problem.ts`](add.problem.ts).
1. Implement the `undefined` constants and functions.
1. Run the exercise until you get the expected results in the console.
