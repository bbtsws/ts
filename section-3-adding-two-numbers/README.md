# Section 3: How to add two numbers

## Introduction 
* We're going to implement addition of two numbers in:
	- the world of values (things that can be assigned to variables)
	- the world of types (things that describe values)
	
But we are not allowed to use +, -, \*, /, \*\*, <<, or >>


### What's the point?
* This is not useful in itself
* It's useful for understanding TS
