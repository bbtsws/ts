### Goals of this section

* Gain an analogy that makes type-level TS familiar
* Gain insight into what is easy / hard / impossible

### What we'll do
* We're going to do a math problem
	- in the world of values (things that can be assigned to variables)
	- in the world of types (things that describe values, help with completions via intellisense or similar, and get erased when TS is compiled to JS)
* Not allowed to use +, -, \*, /, \*\*, <<, or >>


### What's the point?
* This is not useful in itself
* It's useful for understanding TS
 
### Labs
- [lab1 - adding two numbers with values](lab1)
- [lab2 - adding two numbers with types](lab2)
