# How to Add Two Numbers in TypeScript
NodeConf.eu 2019 TypeScript Workshop



## Goal
The TypeScript type system is very powerful and dynamic.  It allows you to go from very simple types to very advanced types with a very low adoption curve.  We go from how to define variables with primitives to how to define types that have a recursive definition.

## Target Audience

JavaScript developers with TypeScript skill levels ranging from beginner to competent.


## Contents

### [Primitive Types](section-1-declarations)
* Couple of lectured exercises in the TypeScript Playground (guided / instruction / teaching)
