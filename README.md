# How to Add Two Numbers in TypeScript
NodeConf.eu 2019 TypeScript Workshop

# Open https://git.io/Jez1u


## Goal
The TypeScript type system is very powerful and dynamic.  It allows you to go from very simple types to very advanced types with a very low adoption curve.  We go from how to define variables with primitives to how to define types that have a recursive definition.

## Target Audience

JavaScript developers with TypeScript skill levels ranging from beginner to competent.


## Sections

### Pre-requisites

Playground:
https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/

[Node.js, TSC, Visual Studio Code](PREREQUISITES.md)

### 1. [Primitive Types](section-1-primitives)
Get started with TypeScript types starting with the basics.  We'll introduce you to TypeScript Playground.

### 2. [Type declarations](section-2-declarations)
Start defining and using your own Types.

### 3. [Add Two Numbers](section-3-adding-two-numbers)
Now let's push the boundaries by creating a new universe of positive numbers and define the addition operation in this new universe.  Then repeat the exercise but using TypeScript's type system.
