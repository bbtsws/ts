# How to Add Two Numbers in TypeScript
NodeConf.eu 2019 TypeScript Workshop



## Goal
The TypeScript type system is very powerful and dynamic.  It allows you to go from very simple types to very advanced types with a very low adoption curve.  We go from how to define variables with primitives to how to define types that have a recursive definition.

## Presenters
* Albert Lash IV
* Philip Cavaco
* Ricardo Le&oacute;n

## Contents

### [Primitive Types](section-1-declarations)
* Couple of lectured exercises in the TypeScript Playground (guided / instruction / teaching)
* Self-guided exercises on Playground - we could walk around

### [Type declarations](section-2-declarations)
* Have a checklist of setup steps?
* Go through compiling

### [Add Two Numbers](section-3-adding-two-numbers)
* These start to walk through the concepts, building up to doing arithmetic
